# Attendance Management System

This project is a **Face Recognition-based Attendance Management System**. It allows users to register students, capture their images, and store their details for attendance tracking. The system also provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

## Features
- **Face Registration**: Capture and save images of students with unique IDs and names.
- **Face Training**: Train a facial recognition model to identify registered faces.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Mark attendance in real-time using facial recognition.
- **Password Protection**: Secure access to sensitive functionalities like training and attendance recording.
- **CSV Reports**: Save attendance records as CSV files for easy management.
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly interface built using `tkinter`.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are required for this project:
- `tkinter`: GUI creation
- `cv2` (OpenCV): Image processing and facial recognition
- `os`: File and directory handling
- `csv`: Handling CSV files
- `numpy`: Numerical operations
- `Pillow`: Image processing
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `datetime`: Handling date and time
- `time`: Time-related functions



## File Structure
Attendance-Management-System/
- **Attendance/                     # Directory to store attendance CSVs**
- **StudentDetails/                 # Directory to store student details CSV**
- **TrainingImage/                  # Directory to save captured training images**
- **TrainingImageLabel/             # Directory to save trained model and password file**
- **haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml  # Haarcascade file for face detection
main.py                         # Main script file**



## Usage Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries mentioned in the **Dependencies** section below.

### Password Management
The system prompts for a password when accessing sensitive functionalities.  
The password can be changed via the **"Change Password"** menu option.

### Attendance Reports
Attendance records are saved as CSV files in the `Attendance/` directory.  
Each record includes:
- **Student ID**
- **Name**
- **Date**
- **Time**
- **Subject**

## Dependencies
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV**
- **Pillow** (PIL)
- **Pandas**

## Acknowledgments
- The facial recognition functionality is powered by **OpenCV**.
- **Haarcascade classifiers** are used for face detection.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the UI for better user experience.
- Add support for multiple camera inputs.
- Implement notifications or reminders for attendance.
- Integrate with databases for better scalability.
